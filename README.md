# Tweeter Project

KiWi is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is a practice LHL project that helps build  HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX, Node, and Express back-end skills.
  1. Provides random user in order to write Kiwis. 
  2. Responsive design adapted for desktop and tablet, since Kiwis dont have hands we are not adapting them for phone use ðŸ˜Ž; 
  3. Kiwis can only type 140 characters and they dont like to send empty messages, therefore when that happens an error pops up. Dont worry if you see it, you can just click back in the text input and you can start over or start typing. Also for the useres convenience when more than 140 characters are type we will erase so you can start over. 
  4. Newest messages will be displayed first.
